Rev is a real-time data processing from IoT sensors, and it enables integration with existing maintenance management systems.
it uses independent queries to helps extend the life of equipment both softwares and hardwares thereby optimize resource use of such equipment.
<h3>As part of RevAi, it will be first specifically tested with IoT equipment, E-commerce,Health systems and Edutech for realtime efficiency as well as sustainablility. Below is a simple RevAi architechture</h3>
